## Getting Started

[min]: https://raw.github.com/jaknyl1/arena/master/dist/arenajs.min.js

The arenajs-lib is used in Axiell Arena which is based on the CMS Liferay. The subdirectory "liferay" contains javascript code to use directly in Liferay as embedded code.


## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the "lib" subdirectory! The "liferay" subdirectory contains examples how to use the lib in Axiell Arena which is based on the CMS Liferay._
